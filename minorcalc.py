#Hello every one this is my first programing experience!!.

#...remember simple operations first being kidies and not pros,,
# just kiding

#here we will add because every person needs more in life. 
Res_Add = num_1 + num_2

#here we will subtract because every person success needs more Sacrifice. 
sub_sad = num_1 - num_2


#here we will multiply because every person needs more repetions to be perfect in life. 
pro_mult = num_1 * num_2

#here we will divide because every person needs more in life. 
Res_div = num_1 / num_2

#now show the users that this is in control
